Kevin believes all elections for all races from President to justice of the peace were fraudulent or none where.  This is the fallacious “thinking” of the left. “Everything is wrong or nothing is.” Silly. https://twitter.com/kgjdenver/status/1327296416130056193

Of course the evidence of anomalies , statistical impossibilities and even eye witness statements or last minute rule changes are overlooked.  Which is also classic confirmation bias. A public official should want transparency and provide proof to reassure the electorate.

This is classic disjointed thinking.  “I don’t see the evidence” therefore I won’t bother to actually investigate.  A very poor start.  Maybe he failed at Easter egg hunting too. “I don’t see any eggs so I won’t look for any eggs.”  The conclusion dictates the action. https://twitter.com/thesteeberteam/status/1326989713639571456

While few people came to your rallies and I never saw one “Raheem for POTUS” sign the people, I mean the media, have spoken.

There seems to be some “confusion” by reporters who obviously know better.  What is evidence? Eye witness testimony.  So when someone says “I checked the database and I voted in two locations” that is evidence.  How widespread this is or anecdotal remains to be seen.
