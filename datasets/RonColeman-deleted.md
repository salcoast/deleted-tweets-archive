One was the Alito question, and I just gave the same answer, privately, to someone myself. Alito may very well have not changed his mind about the issue.

As you can guess based on which side wants which state's law to apply, Alabama law is more protective of the right not to be defamed than New York's law, known to be very tough on defamation plaintiffs.

District court judges do not have deadlines to rule on matters before them.  Here's an unrelated story on what that can mean, from 2004. It's not better now. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/06/nyregion/judges-decisions-are-conspicuously-late.html

(The party asking a court to do something usually gets the last opportunity to be heard - "last licks," you might say.)  The motion has been fully briefed since June 2019.
