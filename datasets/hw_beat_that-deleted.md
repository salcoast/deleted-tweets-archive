Explaining from scratch took many many hours.  I think I should just padlock my account until November 4.   Leak it, let it spread a few hours, padlock, fuck off to GitHub and wait for them to sue me. https://twitter.com/CelerySorbet/status/1304245952203505665

This particular story I put tons of hours into since a lot of it deals with 8chan's inner workings and they had a lot of follow up questions. I just can't start from scratch, I don't have the energy just to see this shit recur.

* [11 September 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200911023450/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1304245642756202496): Nope.   You know how it is. They're all excited about it until it's actually done. Then they don't know you. It's "for sure going to be published" until it's done and then the editor is like "wait I don't care about this why did I request this story?" and ghosts us https://twitter.com/Jordy_Stingray/status/1304244719019417606

If I don't, and Trump wins again, am I going to feel like I didn't do everything I could have?  Now I have to start all over with another reporter if I want this out there and I'm just too damn tired. Fuck you

It's nothing new though.   Here's a paragraph I was sent to fact check on September 2. There's much more. They're sitting on this and ignoring me and the author.   Lol hope you all sue me for copyright infringement. pic.twitter.com/BFmSp4h2yY

That means that one and three times Trump is our president for four more years.   I don't know if you people have been paying attention but we haven't exactly been lucky in 2020 so far https://twitter.com/peterjhasson/status/1300177162738298887

As you know, 8chan is banned from Patreon. I should know, I was admin at the time. 🤭  No harm done, thank you for banning it  @patreon . I'm not mad anymore, any lasting discontent was undone when  @kourge  helped me w/a paper. Now ban QMap.
* [28 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828021712/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1299168958398906368): . @patreon , why are you supporting the main hub for QAnon drops financially? This site, QMAP DOT PUB (banned on Twitter) is the main vector for Q radicalization. Can I call on  @kourge  to please investigate?   https://www.patreon.com/qappanon  pic.twitter.com/1PAk8TtCB1

Let's start.  @patreon , why are you supporting the main hub for QAnon drops financially? This site, QMAP DOT PUB (banned on Twitter) is the main vector for Q radicalization. Can I call on  @kourge  to please investigate?   @paypal , same goes for you.  https://twitter.com/disjuncted/status/1299167182211878913

* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826195917/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1298711182912524289): @jaynitess  I told Watkins that if he's making people sign those he should know they won't hold up in court. Especially in my case. I could just ask a judge to nullify the contract. Telling a disabled man he can't practice his only trade for ten years is overbroad and unreasonable
* [26 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200826195917/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1298711182912524289): Trust me, after I weaseled my way out of signing an NDA with Jim Watkins, he'd be an absolute fool not to be requiring them. 🤭  He also wanted a non-compete from me, barring me from writing any computer software for ten years after quitting. Seriously. https://twitter.com/Jaynitess/status/1298708975551016962

Cringey name for a Q wiki? Maybe, but you can run it how you want I'm pretty sure. No one needs to pay for hosting. https://twitter.com/EryqOuithaqueue/status/1298128494040428544

A modern impotence trial! It will provide a detailed Certificate of Virility, which will note, among other things, how wet the woman got and how many sperm came out.  https://twitter.com/JohnCarmack/status/1294193389164851200

This isn't "lock her up" over emails and Benghazi. 150K+ are dead

On the contrary, I'm calling out Jim Watkins for ABANDONING HIS WIFE WHO HAS COVID19 IN THE PHILIPPINES.  So yes, God broke up his family. Maybe his wife will start to realize the money isn't worth it and dump him. https://twitter.com/IncelsCo/status/1283764716679110656

I don't know for how long.  I'll still post news and projects because that's all anyone cares about. But I'm done browsing this shit hole. Twitter activism is not benefiting me in any way.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623230637/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1275563177338535937): But yeah whatever. I alienated everyone all on my own. I'm only useful to my "friends" if I have some interesting breaking news or some new project.  Maybe  @nezumi_ningen  is the exception here but she has too many of her own problems to check up on mine.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623230637/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1275563177338535937): Over sharing? It's the end of the fuxking world. Or at least the era. So who cares?  America will not survive the year. Whatever we have in 2021 will be something completely new, even if it still calls itself the US. Either socialist, fascist, EU-like, or openly imperialist.

No one expresses concern. This platform is toxic and it's making my mental problems worse.  No one who actually gives a shit if I live or die posts here. Myself included.
* [23 June 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200623230637/https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1275563177338535937): The only person that cares about me is my wife from the last few months  Despite my obviously odd behavior no one else has checked up on me.  The closest was my mother threatening to call the LAPD for a wellness check during riots. When she didn't even ask for a text back first

Sometimes no matter how hard I try to impress upon people in messages what's needed they don't get it until I'm here and it's too late. I haven't complained to Airbnb officially and doubt I will. Just getting a ramp on the cheap. Gotta wait for it to get here.

He then pulls this shit on me, and thinks I'll be what? Flattered? Down for a Skype call to explore a project I never agreed to?  And of course when I'm less then thrilled he gets all offended.

Is this more about Q or 8chan? [Are you] a primary or secondary character?
