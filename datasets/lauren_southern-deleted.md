Twitter isn’t real life. Nor are your schizo video essays.  If all you breadtube freaks had any grip on reality Kyle’s prosecution wouldn’t be looking like this right now. pic.twitter.com/VcVKEsJ43m

The Rittenhouse trial feels like damn good therapy.

Watching people get rejected at check in repeatedly because of constant changing protocols, wrong tests, vax status, tests not received. There's a guy sitting beside me as I type this making panicked calls about his delayed results.
* [ 3 November 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211103125116/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1455880161627295752): Can you guys get new catch phrases and jokes?

Either way, factory farming does have issues.  Which is why you should hunt and kill your own meat, the most ethical and sustainable approach 😎 https://twitter.com/hunteraa6/status/1453005269353500681

"very lastly, the actor checks the gun"  "check the gun, no matter what's going on on set." pic.twitter.com/0SAANgRAQm
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022225634/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451683385919696900): I’m not suggesting he did this intentionally by any means. However clearly there was a weapons safety mishap here, one I reckon we’ll learn more about in the coming days.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022225634/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451683385919696900): There would never be any circumstance where clearance would be given to point and shoot a prop gun at crew who had nothing to do with the shot being filmed.   You’d have a point if it occurred during a filmed scene with another actor perhaps?
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022225553/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451682732224831490): Perhaps we will see more information that clarifies the details later.  However, from my readings on prop and weapons experts on sets - it doesn’t appear there would be any clearance to ever fire or point a weapon at crew who were not in the shots.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022224852/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451681365838077959): Prop guns in films like this are typically not “fake guns” - just guns with ammo that doesn’t fire but makes noise or flashes. Yet can still be dangerous and needs to be used with care. So yes, real gun safety should be used.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022225153/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451679823353430016): It was a rehearsal. The people shot were not even actors in the scene.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022224250/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451679964466593797): Here is proper prop-gun protocol. Something was clearly not followed here. pic.twitter.com/T3CuaiyIl1
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022225153/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451679823353430016): Yes, that is 100% an issue.  https://twitter.com/steinkobbe/status/1451678185913999369  pic.twitter.com/d85aisfXNy
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022223638/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451678646544920582): Wtf are you talking about?   Prop guns are known to be dangerous and should only ever be pointed at the actor involved in the shot, and after clearance by a designated expert.  They’re typically not even used in rehearsals.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022223844/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451677602884702210): No it’s not different with a prop gun, as prop guns are known to be dangerous and therefore should be operated in the same manner.  Actor Brandon Lee was killed in the same way. Prop masters must clear and check the weapon each use. Typically rehearsals shouldn’t even use it.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022223844/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451677602884702210): The Alec Baldwin situation is really tragic, but highlights an essential frustration of legal gun owners.  Their critics know so little about what they critique.  It becomes second nature as a trained gun owner to never point a weapon, even without ammo towards other people.
* [22 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022202500/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1451643207779905540): If this story were true, it is your responsibility to report him. What about others you are putting at risk by leaving this definitely real maniac out there unchallenged?  This totally real individual likely got away with this today because no one reported him before.
* [21 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211021001847/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1450979801251004423): Tfw Satanism goes from burning down Churches and being outlawed to making colouring books for kids that are featured on Kickstarter.

I don't understand all the cheering for this I'm seeing on social media without more context. pic.twitter.com/vacuBeUpwH
* [19 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211019202724/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1450559175193333763): Indigenous community in Canada are preventing social workers from apprehending a child, claiming she broke her collar bone in the system.  The story is seriously lacking in fundamental details. How did she break it? Why was she removed in the first place? https://globalnews.ca/news/8275631/gitanmaax-band-stops-bc-socia-worker-from-seizing-youth/
* [18 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211018062007/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449983578087907330): We're watching the same show and on the same episode... it's actually a well done show though lol...
* [17 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192409/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449814594281558017): It is literally observable on a day to day basis that vaccinated individuals are getting and spreading the virus. The claim that this isn’t true is denying both reality and officials who repeatedly acknowledge this.
* [17 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211017191905/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449815205999906818): I have heard repeatedly from health officials that vaccines reduce symptoms and severity but doesn’t necessarily stop you from getting or giving the virus.  Where is the absurdity in that statement?
* [17 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192409/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449814594281558017): Go reread this interaction please. You’re the one who claimed it was absurd for me to state the vaccine doesn’t fully stop the spread the virus.
* [17 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192121/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449813642900246531): Taking everything you’ve said as 100% accurate still doesn’t make the statement in question wrong.  “vaccines don’t necessarily stop the spread of the virus”  They don’t. That’s why you still have to wear masks when vaccinated.
* [17 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211017190040/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1449812464971833344): Because you can still catch and spread the virus while vaccinated. That is not even controversial. The statements about reduced transmission are still “may” and “might” reduce transmission because research on that is still occurring.  https://twitter.com/dylanarmbruste3/status/1449809358397734912  pic.twitter.com/qEG22pSKRj

Sinatra was man of many talents.  However if he doesn't suffice - how about Lovecraft, Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Jorge Luis Borges, Elvis, Dave Mustaine? https://twitter.com/theneedledrop/status/1448783474555506693

A family friend who flies to Alberta for work befriended some of the staff on his consistently cancelled flight and was told it was because of walk outs, the customer announcement said mechanical issues.

It's not trending, and is barely getting any coverage because the media don't want you to see this obvious systemic bias.
* [ 7 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211007143249/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1446118080061468679): Why yes, I interacted with capitalism and was good at it.

You can't turn back people who have already complied - so you better think of a way to work with them if you dislike the current political landscape.
* [ 5 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211005173501/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1445442077135802368): I'm actually beyond irritated with people who think the only approach to opposing mandates is through non-compliance. Why?   Because I don't like mandates, I want them gone - and if that's your only solution you already lost. The growing majority have already complied.  THINK.

I simply oppose the idea that it is impossible to oppose the mandates while also complying.  It’s historically illiterate - and ignores other effective ways to oppose mandates as well.

You don't need to get this angry about internet politics. People are allowed to grow and mature in their approach without being "frauds". That's a very narrow view.

I'm gonna go make meaningful content instead of circle jerk the same talking points over and over again and create fake e-drama for views. It's meaningless. It's not helping anything. It's the actual grifting.

I've been banned from countries, payment platforms, events etc. it doesn't matter though.  A call for nuance really shouldn't enrage you so much if you aren't (in a cult) afraid of what the other side has to say.

Woman talks about a left-wing media outlet referring to her as a sex object. Left wing media figure complaining about harassment and anti-PC talk blocks her.

Implying my only use is for sex. A journalist did this, not a comedian. You're free to not find any of this funny but it's clear those outraged by bullying/abuse only care when it comes from one side.  https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/1134264641482362880

Trafficking does. The promise of paradise / safety + the shooting of migrants who challenge these people puts it in the very least a gray area of trafficking.

In the middle of my vulnerable moment as friends you started inquiring about an article.  I said I wasn’t sure then said no.

It’s well known that YouTube targets “persona non-grata” accounts. They take down advertising, suggestions, trending etc.   I’m still baffled that people think corporate meddling is a conspiracy.

Willing to retract that if a reasonable explanation is given for all this. As pointed out by others “connectivity” makes little sense.

I said Borderless has officially been made unavailable by Youtube. People are not receiving notifications or community posts. The video is not displaying in my videos... all factual things. Not insane to think of potential censorship.

That was the last email sent before my next one saying “I said not to put that up”.

That’s why we stopped talking. Not because of any falsely applied ideological changes that I had.

We were discussing how to debate the alt-right and I was arguing people needed to understand the terms first.  At the time Spencer referred to himself as a WN. That may have changed since that point.

If you’re still in contact with the rep could you ask how an account with over 700k subs only has a single engagement with a community message in 30mins?

We also lost 70k views. Obviously we're stoked by the Streisand effect and taking advantage of it, but it was pretty devastating initially.

I don’t think people “jumping ship” to another politician who like all of them will disappoint on campaign promises and what they can realistically achieve is the obvious conclusion to such disappointment.

However purely thinking about economic benefits can be devastating too.   Look at the analysis of New Zealand by liberal prof Clive Hamilton. For temporary economic benefit they lost much control of their country to China.   What sort of long term impacts will that have?

The classical definition of liberal would also be quite the opposite of what you’ve described.  You’re correct in popular culture definitions though.

Once personhood is established then further discussion of whether “murder” should be allowed in this case can occur.

Philosophy is unknown territory. We prefer to level accusations against eachother like “murderer / sexist”

* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517175433/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129444533467402241): That’s part of the debate for sure which I have added to the thread.  Whether someone has the right to live off another or not doesn’t become a real question until personhood is established.  Babies cannot live without care from parents. Is it okay to put them in a dumpster?
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517174240/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129442098359357440): Within sects of libertarianism it doesn’t matter if the person will or will not survive without your help. You are only responsible for you.  You are correct when it comes to wider belief in our society though. We do see a responsibility towards those who rely on others.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517173454/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129439595710492672): I’m just saying there would be a libertarian argument of it doesn’t have the right to live off you.   Once viable to survive on its own outside the womb then it wouldn’t be violating anyone’s “private property or resources” etc.   I know not all libertarians believe this.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517172719/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129437688325533696): It makes sense to me for libertarians to be pro-choice until a fetus is viable to live outside the mother’s body. They believe in extreme individualism.  It doesn’t make sense to me for socialists to make the “someone doesn’t have a right to live off me” argument.

Whether the fetus has the right to live off someone.

In Canada abortion is allowed through the whole pregnancy and this goes for some states as well.  It is often also argued that putting any sort of timeline is restrictive and anti-woman’s rights.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517155229/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129414369828167681): One fairly classically liberal dude with only a single political RT of Tulsi on his timeline does not represent the rich historic tradition of conservatism.  An outlook that does promote duty to society and even skepticism of too much freedom if it does not benefit human life.

By “human” I assumed people understood I meant the debate of “humanity / consciousness” and not just that of biology. I could’ve been more clear.

* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517074721/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129292280567746560): Interesting. I guess I see it differently. I’d say I’ve been blessed with the experience of life and this child hasn’t yet so in a “house on fire” scenario I’d save a baby/child first.  The question of abortion however isn’t a house on fire scenario. It’s not one or the other.

I just don’t see that happening.

I haven’t seen a single pro-choice individual say “as long as it can live outside my body it’s fine”.   So I don’t think it’s off topic.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517073813/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129289438188544001): 22 week old fetus can live outside the mother’s body.

So is the determining factor of whether someone has a right to life consciousness?   What about those in comas?   What about newborns? They don’t really have conscious experience until 5 months old?
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517071720/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129284724717842432): Ok, following that logic should abortion be banned at 22 weeks because the baby can survive outside the mother at that point?
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517071433/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129284025527332864): You have to be able to understand eachother first to get anywhere. People may as well be having yelling matches in different languages at the moment.

This person vs non person issue is the debate not all the other goal post shifts people are bringing up.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517070843/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129282536994033664): I’m not making a point in bad faith like you assume I am. I’d go back and edit the post to say “person” if I could just to get rid of this minor semantics debate - because I genuinely did not see the slight nuance.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517065831/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129279988287430656): I’m not fully understanding the debate here about me using the word human vs person.   They seem fairly interchangeable. pic.twitter.com/AFU8yT1hzW

If the fetus is a human then it is murder and it has nothing to do with the rights of the woman.  No one has the right to murder. It’s about the rights of the baby.  I don’t understand why people can’t just stay on topic.
* [17 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190517064712/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129277142305366016): I have never seen so many terrible arguments in a single debate than the one surrounding abortion.  The fundamental debate here is - is a fetus a human or not.  No one is arguing for what they see as murder.  No one is arguing against women’s rights.   All I see is derailing.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516172452/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129075223435784192): Pro-life argues abortion is murder.  We can impose laws against murder that the majority of society religious and non religious agree with.  The pro-life argument is very simple yet many try to argue / derail with comments about freedom & big government.  See first tweet.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516171353/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129072465664102400): It’s actually not strange for a conservative to say that at all.  Conservatism is an ideology based on natural law and duty to society.  Liberalism is the freedom / individualism based belief.  People have just confused them as of late. “Conservatives” included.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516164948/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129065860956446720): That’s what the debate is about.

I’m saying he’s derailed the conversation when it’s about morality.   This question of natural law or absolute morality can also exist outside of religion.

It’s not ridiculous to point out the debate is in this realm.  Nor is it ridiculous to call out when people try to derail this.
* [16 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190516162732/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1129060799090028545): This is just bad logic. It’s not a question of freedom but one of absolute morality.  Are there some things humans can never do? Ie. murder / genocide.  No one accuses arguments against genocide to be anti-freedom.  Pro-life believe this is murder. You have to address that claim.

I realize not all do this, but unfortunately the loudest do.

I believe there should be reform in the meat industry too. Yet I realize there is often a necessity to cull animal populations for sustainability. A necessity to eat meat.
* [14 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190514015845/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1128117388207984640): Ok so it's not that you see the death as animals as having an exact equivalence to humans, but rather want suffering for them reduced when possible. That's fair, I just often wonder if vegans realize what a privileged position it is to be able to adjust ones diet to that extent.
* [14 May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190514015600/https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1128116148208168960): I don't like the meat industry either, and personally try my best to buy free-range / ethical meat when the option is there. However it bothers me how many don't realize the majority of the world don't have the wealth and accessibility to stand on their same high-horse.

Much of the world don't have access to vegan options & would die if they did not hunt.

People make their life about amassing followers then forget this is just a digital colosseum. The crowds will cheer just as loudly when you’re torn apart.

Not that I endorse it, I just find it amusing that no one seems to realize their liberalism is fleeting in a world where there’s no cultural protectionism.

NA is not a pure free market. There are tax cuts, labour laws, subsidies, restrictions & monopolies as a result.

Today’s Christian majority nations do not actively persecute homosexuals, and in fact in many churches preach love towards them.  I don’t believe we can say the same for majority Islamic nations.

So do tell me  @alibreland   @MotherJones  what misinformation did I spread about the Notre Dame fire? Cause I only made one tweet about it lamenting it’s loss.

That doesn’t mean 0 immigration, that doesn’t mean only for white people.  This is a pretty standard viewpoint worldwide.

I’m not sure you’re even worth talking to considering you can’t even tell that second tweet is a joke. None of those things are races or genders.
