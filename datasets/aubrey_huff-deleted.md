If he played with  @Twins  for 20 seasons without the offensive firepower the  @Yankees  had hitting around him every year, would he still have the numbers he did? Yes he’s a Hall of Famer most likely. But not the baseball god NY made him. https://twitter.com/ouruss/status/1221130818531102723

He played for 20 years with the  @Yankees  with offensively loaded teams. It’s easier to hit with 8 other guys behind you that scare the pitcher more.
